:n: Elastic Cloud Terraform provider
:p: tpec

The {n} allows you to provision Elastic Cloud deployments on any Elastic Cloud platform, whether itâ€™s Elasticsearch Service or Elastic Cloud Enterprise.

The provider lets you manage Elastic Cloud deployments as code, and introduce DevOps-driven methodologies to manage and deploy the Elastic Stack and solutions.

IMPORTANT: The provider is not subject to the support service level agreement (SLA.) You can use the Elastic Cloud APIs or user console directly to perform changes as a workaround.
