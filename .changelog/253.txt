```release-note:breaking-change
datasource/ec_deployment: Adds support for the newly added data tiers. A new **required** field `elasticsearch.toplogy.id` has been added, it needs to be set to all **explicit** Elasticsearch topology declarations. A `node_roles` computed field has been added to the schema and **cannot** be overridden by the user, versions `>=7.10.0` will be automatically migrated by the provider to use `node_roles` from the `node_type_*` settings, these will be removed from the state. When `node_type_*` fields are explicitly set in the terraform configuration they need to be unset manually by the user. Additionally, it removes the `elasticsearch.version` computed field.
```
