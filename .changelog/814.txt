```release-note:feature
resource/deployment: Automatically add a dedicated master tier when it is required due to the number of nodes in the cluster. Also removes it again if the number of nodes drops below the threshold for a dedicated master tier.
This does not affect configurations that have explicitly configured a master tier.
```
