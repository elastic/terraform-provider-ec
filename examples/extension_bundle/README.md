# Extension Bundle example

This example shows how to create an Elastic Cloud bundle extension using Terraform.

The bundle extension is created with `files/content.json` uploaded.

## Running the example

To run the example, follow these steps:

1. Build the provider by running `make install` from the main folder.
2. Run `terrafrom init` to initialize your Terraform CLI.
3. Run `terraform apply` to see how it works.
