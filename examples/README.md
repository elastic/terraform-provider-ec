# Elastic Cloud (EC) Provider Examples

This directory contains a set of examples of using various Elastic Cloud resources with Terraform. The examples each have their own README containing more details on what the example does.

To run any example clone the repository. Build the provider using `make install` from the main folder. From within the example's directory run `terrafrom init` to initialize Terrafrom, and `terraform apply` to see it work.
