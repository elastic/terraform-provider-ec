# Elastic Cloud provider examples

This directory contains a set of examples that show you how to use Elastic Cloud resources with Terraform. For each example there is a README file with a detailed description.

To run any example, clone the repository. Build the provider using `make install` from the main folder. From within the example's directory, run `terraform init` to initialize Terraform, and `terraform apply` to apply the changes.
