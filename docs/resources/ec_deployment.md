# Resource: ec_deployment

Provides an Elastic Cloud deployment resource, which allows deployments to be created, updated, and deleted.

~> **Note on Elastic Stack versions** Using a version prior to `6.6.0` is not supported.

~> **Note on traffic filters** If you use `traffic_filter` on an `ec_deployment`, Terraform will manage the full set of traffic rules for the deployment, and treat additional traffic filters as drift. For this reason, `traffic_filter` cannot be mixed with the `ec_deployment_traffic_filter_association` resource for a given deployment.

-> **Note on regions and deployment templates** Before you start, you might want to read about [Elastic Cloud deployments](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-create-deployment.html) and check the [full list](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-regions-templates-instances.html) of regions and deployment templates available in Elasticsearch Service (ESS).

-> **Note on Elasticsearch topology IDs** Since the addition of data tiers, each Elasticsearch topology block requires the `"id"` field to be set. The accepted values are set in the deployment template that you have chosen, but values are closely related to the Elasticsearch data tiers. [Learn more abut Elasticsearch data tiers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/data-tiers.html). For a complete list of all the supported values, refer to the deployment template definition used by your deployment.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```hcl
data "ec_stack" "latest" {
  version_regex = "latest"
  region        = "us-east-1"
}

resource "ec_deployment" "example_minimal" {
  # Optional name.
  name = "my_example_deployment"

  # Mandatory fields
  region                 = "us-east-1"
  version                = data.ec_stack.latest.version
  deployment_template_id = "aws-io-optimized-v2"

  elasticsearch {}

  kibana {}

  apm {}

  enterprise_search {}
}
```

### Tiered deployment with Autoscaling enabled

      size = "8g"
    }

    topology {
      id   = "hot_content"
      size = "8g"

      autoscaling {
        // Optionally change the policy max size.
        // max_size = "29g"
      }
    }

    topology {
      id   = "warm"
      size = "16g"

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Required) Elasticsearch Service (ESS) region where to create the deployment. For Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) installations, set `"ece-region"`.

-> If you change the `region`, the resource will be destroyed and re-created.

* `deployment_template_id` - (Required) Deployment template identifier to create the deployment from. See the [full list](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-regions-templates-instances.html) of regions and deployment templates available in ESS.
* `version` - (Required) Elastic Stack version to use for all the deployment resources.

-> Read the [ESS stack version policy](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-version-policy.html#ec-version-policy-available) to understand which versions are available.

* `name` - (Optional) Name of the deployment.
* `alias` - (Optional) Deployment alias, affects the format of the resource URLs.
* `request_id` - (Optional) Request ID to set when you create the deployment. Use it only when previous attempts return an error and `request_id` is returned as part of the error.
* `elasticsearch` (Required) Elasticsearch cluster definition, can only be specified once. For multi-node Elasticsearch clusters, use multiple `topology` blocks.
* `kibana` (Optional) Kibana instance definition, can only be specified once.

-> **Note on disabling Kibana** While optional it is recommended deployments specify a Kibana block, since not doing so might cause issues when modifying or upgrading the deployment.

* `apm` (Optional) APM instance definition, can only be specified once.
* `enterprise_search` (Optional) Enterprise Search server definition, can only be specified once. For multi-node Enterprise Search deployments, use multiple `topology` blocks.
* `traffic_filter` (Optional) List of traffic filter rule identifiers that will be applied to the deployment.
* `observability` (Optional) Observability settings that you can set to ship logs and metrics to a separate deployment.
* `tags` (Optional) Key value map of arbitrary string tags.

### Resources

!> **Warning on removing explicit topology objects** Due to current limitations, if a topology object is removed from the configuration, the removal won't trigger any changes since the field is optional and computed. There is no way to determine if the block was removed, which results in a _"sticky"_ topology configuration. To disable a topology element, set the `topology.size` to `"0g"`.

To create a valid deployment, you must specify at least the resource type `elasticsearch`. The supported resources are listed below.

A default topology from the deployment template is used for empty blocks: `elasticsearch {}`, `kibana {}`, `apm {}`, `enterprise_search {}`. When a block is not set, the resource kind is not enabled in the deployment.

The `ec_deployment` resource will opt-out all the resources except Elasticsearch, which inherits the default topology from the deployment template. For example, the [I/O Optimized template includes an Elasticsearch cluster 8 GB memory x 2 availability zones](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-getting-started-profiles.html#ec-getting-started-profiles-io).

To customize the size or settings of the deployment resource, use the `topology` block within each resource kind block. The `topology` blocks are ordered lists and should be defined in the Terraform configuration in an ascending manner by alphabetical order of the `id` field.

#### Elasticsearch

The required `elasticsearch` block supports the following arguments:

* `topology` - (Optional) Can be set multiple times to compose complex topologies.
* `ref_id` - (Optional) Can be set on the Elasticsearch resource. The default value `main-elasticsearch` is recommended.
* `config` (Optional) Elasticsearch settings applied to all topologies unless overridden in the `topology` element. 
* `remote_cluster` (Optional) Elasticsearch remote clusters to configure for the Elasticsearch resource. Can be set multiple times.
* `snapshot_source` (Optional) Restores data from a snapshot of another deployment.
* `extension` (Optional) Custom Elasticsearch bundles or plugins. Can be set multiple times.
* `autoscale` (Optional) Enable or disable autoscaling. Defaults to the setting coming from the deployment template. Accepted values are `"true"` or `"false"`.
* `trust_account` (Optional) The trust relationships with other ESS accounts.
* `trust_external` (Optional) The trust relationship with external entities (remote environments, remote accounts...).

##### Topology

To set up multi-node Elasticsearch clusters, you can set the topology block multiple times. Each block must specify the `id` field referencing the data tier name. This is particularly relevant for Elasticsearch clusters with multiple data tiers or Machine lLearning.

-> To avoid infinite diff loops, topology blocks should be ordered alphabetically by the `topology.id` field. The order with the current data tiers at the time of this writing would be: "cold", "coordinating", "frozen", "hot_content", "master", "ml", "warm".

The optional `elasticsearch.topology` block supports the following arguments:

* `id` - (Required) Unique topology identifier. It generally refers to an Elasticsearch data tier, such as `hot_content`, `warm`, `cold`, `coordinating`, `frozen`, `ml` or `master`.
* `size` - (Optional) Amount in Gigabytes per topology element in the `"<size in GB>g"` notation. When omitted, it defaults to the deployment template value.
* `size_resource` - (Optional) Type of resource to which the size is assigned. Defaults to `"memory"`.
* `zone_count` - (Optional) Number of zones the instance type of the Elasticsearch cluster will span. This is used to set or unset HA on an Elasticsearch node type. When omitted, it defaults to the deployment template value.
* `node_type_data` - (Optional) The node type for the Elasticsearch cluster (data node).
* `node_type_master` - (Optional) The node type for the Elasticsearch cluster (master node).
* `node_type_ingest` - (Optional) The node type for the Elasticsearch cluster (ingest node).
* `node_type_ml` - (Optional) The node type for the Elasticsearch cluster (machine learning node).
* `autoscaling` - (Optional) Autoscaling policy defining the maximum and / or minimum total size for this topology element. For more information refer to the `autoscaling` block.

~> **Note when node_type_* fields set** After upgrading to a version that supports data tiers (7.10.0 or above), the `node_type_*` has no effect even if specified. The provider automatically migrates the `node_type_*` fields to the appropriate `node_roles` as set by the deployment template. After having upgraded to `7.10.0` or above, the fields should be removed from the terraform configuration, if explicitly configured.

##### Autoscaling

The optional `elasticsearch.autoscaling` block supports the following arguments:

* `min_size` - (Optional) Defines the minimum size the deployment will scale down to. When set, scale down will be enabled, please note that not all the tiers support this option.
* `min_size_resource` - (Optional) Defines the resource type the scale down will use (Defaults to `"memory"`).
* `max_size` - (Optional) Defines the maximum size the deployment will scale up to. When set, scaling up will be enabled. All tiers should support this option.
* `max_size_resource` - (Optional) Defines the resource type the scale up will use (Defaults to `"memory"`).

-> Note that none of these settings will take effect unless `elasticsearch.autoscale` is set to `"true"`.

Please refer to the [Deployment Autoscaling](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-autoscaling.html) documentation for an updated list of the Elasticsearch tiers supporting scale up and scale down.

##### Config

The optional `elasticsearch.config` block supports the following arguments:

* `plugins` - (Optional) List of Elasticsearch supported plugins. Check the Stack Pack version to see which plugins are supported for each version. This is currently only available from the UI and [ecctl](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecctl/master/ecctl_stack_list.html).
* `user_settings_json` - (Optional) JSON-formatted user level `elasticsearch.yml` setting overrides.
* `user_settings_override_json` - (Optional) JSON-formatted admin (ECE) level `elasticsearch.yml` setting overrides.
* `user_settings_yaml` - (Optional) YAML-formatted user level `elasticsearch.yml` setting overrides.
* `user_settings_override_yaml` - (Optional) YAML-formatted admin (ECE) level `elasticsearch.yml` setting overrides.

##### Remote Cluster

The optional `elasticsearch.remote_cluster` block can be set multiple times. It represents one or multiple remote clusters to which the local Elasticsearch cluster connects for Cross Cluster Search and supports the following settings:

* `deployment_id` (Required) Remote deployment ID.
* `alias` (Required) Alias for the Cross Cluster Search binding.
* `ref_id` (Optional) Remote Elasticsearch `ref_id`. The default value `main-elasticsearch` is recommended.
* `skip_unavailable` (Optional) If true, skip the cluster during search when disconnected. Defaults to `false`.

##### Snapshot source

The optional `elasticsearch.snapshot_source` block, which restores data from a snapshot of another deployment, supports the following arguments:

* `source_elasticsearch_cluster_id` (Required) ID of the Elasticsearch cluster, not to be confused with the deployment ID, that will be used as the source of the snapshot. The Elasticsearch cluster must be in the same region and must have a compatible version of the Elastic Stack.
* `snapshot_name` (Optional) Name of the snapshot to restore. Use `__latest_success__` to get the most recent successful snapshot (Defaults to `__latest_success__`).

~> **Note on behavior** The `snapshot_source` block will not be saved in the Terraform state due to its transient nature. This means that whenever the `snapshot_source` block is set, a snapshot will **always be restored**, unless removed before running `terraform apply`.

##### Extension

The optional `elasticsearch.extension` block, allows custom plugins or bundles to be configured in the Elasticsearch cluster. It supports the following arguments:

* `name` (Required) Extension name.
* `type` (Required) Extension type, only `bundle` or `plugin` are supported.
* `version` (Required) Elasticsearch compatibility version. Bundles should specify major or minor versions with wildcards, such as `7.*` or `*` but **plugins must use full version notation down to the patch level**, such as `7.10.1` and wildcards are not allowed.
* `url` (Required) Bundle or plugin URL, the extension URL can be obtained from the `ec_deployment_extension.<name>.url` attribute or the API and cannot be a random HTTP address that is hosted elsewhere.

##### Trust Account

~> **Note on Computed Account Trusts** If your account has the default trust setting set to `Trust all my deployments (includes future deployments)`, the `trust_account` will always contain 1 element that sets up that trust. If that element is manually removed, the trust default will be unset for the cluster.

The optional `elasticsearch.trust_account` block, allows cross-account trust relationships to be set. It supports the following arguments:

* `account_id` (Required) The account identifier to establish the new trust with.
* `trust_all` (Optional) If true, all clusters in this account will by default be trusted and the `trust_allowlist` is ignored.
* `trust_allowlist` (Optional) The list of clusters to trust. Only used when `trust_all` is `false`.
