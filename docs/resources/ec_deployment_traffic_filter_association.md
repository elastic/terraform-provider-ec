# Resource: ec_deployment_traffic_filter_association

Provides an Elastic Cloud traffic filter association resource. Allowing traffic filter rules to be associated to an Elastic Cloud deployment outside of the  control of Terraform, allowing associations to be created and deleted.

~> **Note on traffic filters** If you use `traffic_filter` on an `ec_deployment`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of traffic rules for the deployment, and treat additional traffic filters as drift. For this reason, `traffic_filter` cannot be mixed with the `ec_deployment_traffic_filter_association` resource for a given deployment.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ec_deployment" "example" {
  id = "320b7b540dfc967a7a649c18e2fce4ed"
}

resource "ec_deployment_traffic_filter" "example" {
  name   = "my traffic filter name"
  region = "us-east-1"
  type   = "ip"

  rule {
    source = "0.0.0.0/0"
  }
}

resource "ec_deployment_traffic_filter_association" "example" {
  traffic_filter_id = ec_deployment_traffic_filter.example.id
  deployment_id     = ec_deployment.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `traffic_filter_id` - (Required) Traffic filter ID of the rule to use for the attachment.
* `deployment_id` - (Required) Deployment ID of the deployment to which attach the traffic filter rule.
