# Resource: ec_deployment_traffic_filter

Provides an Elastic Cloud traffic filter resource, which allows traffic filter rules to be created, updated, and deleted. Traffic filter rules are used to limit inbound traffic to deployment resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ec_stack" "latest" {
  version_regex = "latest"
  region        = "us-east-1"
}

# Create an Elastic Cloud deployment
resource "ec_deployment" "example_minimal" {
  # Optional name.
  name = "my_example_deployment"

  # Mandatory fields
  region                 = "us-east-1"
  version                = data.ec_stack.latest.version
  deployment_template_id = "aws-io-optimized-v2"

  traffic_filter = [
    ec_deployment_traffic_filter.example.id
  ]

  # Use the deployment template defaults
  elasticsearch {}

  kibana {}
}

resource "ec_deployment_traffic_filter" "example" {
  name   = "my traffic filter name"
  region = "us-east-1"
  type   = "ip"

  rule {
    source = "0.0.0.0/0"
  }
}
```
