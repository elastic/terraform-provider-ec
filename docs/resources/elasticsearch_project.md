# Resource: ec_elasticsearch_project

## Technical preview

This functionality is in technical preview and may be changed or removed in a future release.
Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ec_elasticsearch_project" "my_project" {
  name      = "my_project"
  region_id = "aws-us-east-1"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Descriptive name for a project.
- `region_id` (String) Unique human-readable identifier for a region in Elastic Cloud.

### Optional

- `alias` (String) A custom domain label compatible with RFC-1035 standards. Derived from the project name by default.
- `optimized_for` (String) The purpose for which the hardware of this elasticsearch project is optimized for. Also known as the Elasticsearch project subtype.
- `search_lake` (Attributes) Configuration for entire set of capabilities that make the data searchable in Elasticsearch. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--search_lake))

### Read-Only

- `cloud_id` (String) The cloud ID, an encoded string that provides other Elastic services with the necessary information to connect to this Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- `credentials` (Attributes) Basic auth credentials to access the Elasticsearch API. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--credentials))
- `endpoints` (Attributes) The endpoints to access the different apps of the project. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints))
- `id` (String) ID of the project.
- `metadata` (Attributes) Additional details about the project. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `type` (String) the type of the project

### Nested Schema for `search_lake`

Optional:

- `boost_window` (Number) Determines how much data can benefit from faster search. When ingested, a certain amount of data is loaded into a cache that makes it super fast to query. The system dynamically adjusts the cache allocated to your project based on how much data you ingest during the period defined by your Search Boost Window.
- `search_power` (Number) Controls how fast searches are against your project data. When ingested, a certain amount of data is loaded into a cache that makes it super fast to query. You can either increase the performance of searches on cached data by adding replicas, or reduce the quantity of cached data by a static factor to save on costs.


<a id="nestedatt--credentials"></a>
### Nested Schema for `credentials`

Read-Only:

- `password` (String) Basic auth password that can be used to access the Elasticsearch API.
- `username` (String) Basic auth username that can be used to access the Elasticsearch API.


<a id="nestedatt--endpoints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `endpoints`

Read-Only:

- `elasticsearch` (String) The endpoint to access elasticsearch.
- `kibana` (String) The endpoint to access kibana.


<a id="nestedatt--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Read-Only:

- `created_at` (String) Date and time when the project was created.
- `created_by` (String) ID of the user.
- `organization_id` (String) The Organization ID who owns the project.
- `suspended_at` (String) Date and time when the project was suspended.
- `suspended_reason` (String) Reason why the project was suspended.

## Import

Projects can be imported using the `id`, for example:

```shell
terraform import ec_elasticsearch_project.id 320b7b540dfc967a7a649c18e2fce4ed
