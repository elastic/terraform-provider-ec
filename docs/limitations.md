# Limitations

This document aims to document the limitations of the terraform provider for development purposes.
Intended as internal (temporary) documentation and will be removed eventually.

## Version field diff

When upgrading the version of a deployment from A to B, the diff will look like this:

```diff
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # ec_deployment.example_minimal will be updated in-place

## Elasticsearch resource

### Cluster monitoring

Stopping monitoring on a cluster, doesn't seem to be possible through the API. Reported in <https://github.com/elastic/cloud/issues/57821>.

This would happen when the block `monitoring_settings` of an Elasticsearch resource is removed.
